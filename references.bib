	abstract = {Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue in the domain of the visual system: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex. The presented model satisfies an extensive range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modelled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.Author summary Computational modeling can integrate fragments of understanding generated by experimental neuroscience. However, most models considered only a few features of neural computation at a time, leading to either poorly constrained models with many parameters, or lack of expressiveness in over-simplified models. A solution is to develop detailed models, but constrain them with a broad range of anatomical and functional data to prevent overfitting. This requires a long-term systematic approach. Here we present a first snapshot of such an integrative program: a large-scale spiking model of cat primary visual cortex, that is constrained by an extensive range of anatomical and functional features. Together with the associated modeling infrastructure, this study lays the groundwork for a broad integrative modeling program seeking an in-depth understanding of vision.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
