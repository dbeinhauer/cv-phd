    \item {Master thesis \vline \:} \href{https://github.com/dbeinhauer/mcs-source}{GitHub (Code)},
    \href{https://github.com/dbeinhauer/mcs-thesis}{GitHub (Thesis text)}
    \item Developed a biologically realistic model of primary visual cortex (V1) leveraging modular multi-layered recurrent neural networks.
    \item Successfully mapped one-to-one synthetic neurons of state-of-the-art spiking neural network model of V1.
    \item Showed that biological realism is essential to capture temporal dynamics of the visual system.
    \item Results of the study were presented in poster session by my supervisor [2], and updated results are planned to be presented by me [1] in October.
    \item Helped to mentor fellow bachelor student focusing on the extension of the core research.
